In this directory I'll put all the ansible playbooks to setup the
Raspberry Pi cluster from a control node

Disclaimer: I'm quite new to Ansible, there could be better ways to do what I'm doing here.
Credits:  I've built my playbooks by studying the setup shared by https://www.jeffgeerling.com/ for his Dramble project ( http://www.pidramble.com/). Thanks Jeff Geerling.


To setup the Pis which make up your cluster, check network/README.md
